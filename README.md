# MyFirstProject
I created this project after finishing a Full Stack Automation course.
The Project is written in Java, and I used Selenium, Appium, Rest-assured and TestNG as the testing tools. 
This project includes a framework which can be used for multiple platforms, such as Web, Mobile, API, Electron and Desktop applications.
The test cases are written seperately for each platform and use Page Objects method, and the project is also integrated with a MySQL DB.

***There is a contradiction between Appium dependencies, one is used for mobile and the other for desktop - must be taken care of when running each type of them.
